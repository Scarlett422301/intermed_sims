## Description

The `intermed_sims` repository contains the code needed to reproduce the simulation results of the manuscript, "Nonparametric inference for interventional effects with multiple mediators."

-----

## The `intermed` package

The simulations rely on the [`intermed`](https://github.com/benkeser/intermed) R package, which can be downloaded and installed from GitHub as follows.

```r
devtools::install_github("benkeser/intermed")
```

-----

## Additional simulation 3

Code for the additional simulation 3 in the appendix is included in the `add_sim3` directory, which includes its own `README` file detailing the contents. This simulation study compares the proposed approach with parametric approaches by [`Vansteelandt and Daniel (2017)`](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27922534/).
